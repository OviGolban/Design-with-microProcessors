# Design-with-microProcessors
Here I present an interesting project which uses duplex communication between Pycharm and Arduino IDE. Also, I use Python for do plot between 2 points read from AD8232 Sensor. I calculate the slope of the line for 2 consecutive points and for the entire period I calculate sum for all slopes. If sum is bigger than 0 I write on a I2C LCD that the patient is stressed or is sum is smaller than 0 I write on same LCD that the patient is relaxed.
